# Arvind-Brands--Digital-KYC-Hackathon
When a customer visits a store, he/she visits some areas of the store and spends more of his/her time in a particular region than any other region. This is mostly because, that particular region interests that particular customer more. This behavior is followed by all the people visiting the store and is a part of customer psychology. The region of interest varies from person to person. However, there are certain places in the store where the customer density is considerably high most of the times irrespective of the customer preference. these areas can be considered "hotspots" of the store.

Our aim is to utilize the already installed CCTV cameras in the store and using computer vision techniques, identify the potential hotspots of the store.

It is useful to gain information about what type of products or what section of store interests the customer more than the other. This information can be used to identify some problems like,

1.customers are showing less interest in which products?
2.where should the less interesting products be moved so as to get customer's attention?
3.where should a newly launched product be placed to ensure max sales
4.in case of advertising about something, where should a poster be placed to get maximum attention of customers
